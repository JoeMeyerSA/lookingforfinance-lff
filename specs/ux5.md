# ux5 — Solar / Backup Power Pathway Specification (LFF) v1.3 (Locked)

## 0. Navigation contract — Five gates only (non-negotiable)

The website is organised only by these five gates: Individual, Business, Farmer, Developer, Solar / Backup Power.

Users must enter through one gate and remain inside it; do not present any alternative slicing (no cross-gate “solutions catalogue”, “browse all solutions”, or industry-based menus).

Any choices shown after entering a gate exist only to route the user to the correct dedicated Pocket Business eligibility form (or are captured as intent inside that form).

## 0.1 Eligibility flow contract — dedicated PB forms + form-specific outcome message (non-negotiable)

After selecting a gate and then a need within that gate, the only next step is the Check eligibility CTA.

Clicking Check eligibility opens one dedicated Pocket Business enquiry form in the Action panel (right) with guidance on the left. The form is 1:1 mapped to that specific gate + need.

Website forms collect only minimum viable identity + consent + routing + selection-specific qualifiers; do not ask early underwriting inputs (e.g., income bands, time-in-role/time trading) and do not request document uploads.

Any legal entity selector appears only inside the relevant Business / Farmer / Solar forms (packaging-only), never for Individuals and never as a solutions-level concept.

On submit, the payload is sent to Pocket Business to trigger follow-up automations. The post-submit screen is a confirmation/outcome message defined per PB form (not a generic site-wide message) and must avoid “approval” language.

## Change log

v1.2 (2026-01-08): Formatting normalised to markdown only (no behavioural changes).

## Specification

UX5 — Solar / Backup Power Pathway Specification (LFF) Document control File ID + Title: UX5 — Solar / Backup Power Pathway Specification (LFF) Version: v1.3 Status: Final (Locked) Applies to: LookingForFinance.co.za — Solar / Backup Power selector experience + dedicated eligibility check forms (SOL‑A to SOL‑D) Owner: LookingForFinance (LFF) Last updated: 2026-01-07 Precedence note: If this conflicts with UX0, UX0 wins. If a solution-scope question arises, SOL‑01 wins. Conformance stamp (universal) This UX specification conforms to: UX0 — Selector-to-Enquiry Interaction Pathway (active version as defined in agents.md) SOL‑01 — Solutions Offered & Scope (active version as defined in agents.md) PX‑01 — Experience & Design Principles (active version as defined in agents.md) DATA‑01 — Form Data Dictionary (active version as defined in agents.md) …and must apply the universal rules throughout, including: Two-stage model (locked): select first, then capture data. Two-panel pattern: Guidance module + Action module. System states A–D: and their behaviour (CTA enablement, guidance updates, form behaviour). Guidance format (locked): 4-block structure (see UX0) + one calm truth line (no promises). Validation priority: first invalid field gets focus and guidance. Copy governance: no implied approval, no guarantees, no lender endorsements. Fees microcopy + Protection microcopy: use the locked verbatim blocks from UX0 (do not rewrite).

Purpose and scope 1.1 Purpose Define the Solar / Backup Power pathway selector (no data capture) and the four dedicated eligibility check forms, with build-ready routing, field sets, and guidance behaviour. 1.2 Scope boundaries This specification covers: The Solar / Backup Power selector page (no personal/business data capture). Four dedicated eligibility check forms: SOL‑A — Residential solar / backup power finance SOL‑B — Business solar / backup power finance SOL‑C — Agriculture solar / backup power finance SOL‑D — Battery & inverter upgrade Out of scope: Full application forms, underwriting detail, document collection, payment capture. Any promise of approval, rates, or terms. 1.3 Definition (consistent with UX0/PX‑01) Selector stage: user selects an option; no personal/business data captured. Eligibility check: a short enquiry form (≈2–3 minutes) to assess initial fit and package a funder-ready enquiry; not a full application.

Solar / Backup Power selector stage 2.1 Two-panel page structure (selector stage) Guidance module (Left): Shows static Solar / Backup Power guidance in State A. Updates to option-specific guidance in State C. Displays fees + optional protection note using UX0 locked microcopy. Action module (Right): Shows the four single-select option tiles. Primary CTA (disabled until a selection is made). Secondary actions: “Change pathway” / “Back to finance choices”. 2.2 System states (applied to Solar / Backup Power) 2.2.1 State A — Page loaded (no option selected) Action module: Show the four options. Primary CTA disabled. Helper text under CTA: “Select an option above to continue.” Guidance module: “Where you are” line: “Solar / Backup Power — choose what you need.” Static guidance blocks (see Section 3.1). 2.2.2 State C — Option selected Action module: Selected tile shows selected state. Primary CTA enabled with dynamic label: “Check eligibility for {Selected option label}” Guidance module: Switch to option-specific 4-block guidance (Section 3.2). Show fees microcopy for the selected option (UX0 verbatim). Show the optional protection note (UX0 verbatim). 2.2.3 State D — Dedicated enquiry form open Action module: Render the selected SOL‑A/B/C/D form. Selector-stage CTA is replaced by the form. Guidance module: Show the form-open banner (Section 4.2). On field focus (and on first invalid field), show micro-guides (Section 6). 2.3 Primary CTA rules (selector stage) Disabled label: “Select an option to check eligibility” Enabled label: “Check eligibility for {Selected option label}” On click: open the matching dedicated form (SOL‑A/B/C/D). 2.4 Secondary actions Change pathway: takes the user back to capacity selection. Back to finance choices: takes the user back to the main starting point. Data-loss warning rule: if the user has started a form (State D), warn that changing option/pathway may discard entered data.

Selector options and guidance library 3.1 Options catalogue (locked labels) Residential solar / backup power finance Business solar / backup power finance Agriculture solar / backup power finance Battery & inverter upgrade 3.2 Routing map (selector → form) Residential solar / backup power finance → SOL‑A Business solar / backup power finance → SOL‑B Agriculture solar / backup power finance → SOL‑C Battery & inverter upgrade → SOL‑D 3.3 Guidance copy (State A — no option selected) Use UX0’s locked guidance structure. Baseline Solar / Backup Power guidance must communicate: You’re doing: Choosing the Solar / Backup Power route that matches your situation. Why we ask: Solar funding routes differ depending on context and system type. What to enter: Choose the closest match — you can refine details later. What happens next: You’ll complete a short eligibility check so we can route you correctly. Truth line (one line, calm): “This is a short eligibility check — not approval. Outcomes remain subject to assessment and final approval.” 3.4 Guidance copy (State C — by option) 3.4.1 Residential solar / backup power finance You’re doing: Checking whether your household solar / backup plan can be structured sensibly. Why we ask: Funders assess household affordability and system intent differently. What to enter: Best estimates are fine; if you’re unsure, choose “Not sure”. What happens next: We sanity-check the inputs, confirm the best route, then proceed to lender matching. Truth line: “Outcomes remain subject to assessment and final approval by the relevant funder.” 3.4.2 Business solar / backup power finance You’re doing: Checking whether a solar / backup solution for a business site can be funded. Why we ask: Business viability signals help route your enquiry to the right appetite. What to enter: Provide the closest turnover/electricity estimates; we can refine later. What happens next: We confirm the route and request any missing info only if it matters. Truth line: “This starts a structured lender-match request — it is not approval.” 3.4.3 Agriculture solar / backup power finance You’re doing: Checking whether solar / backup for farm operations (including irrigation) can be structured. Why we ask: Use-case, seasonality, and site context influence lender fit and required info. What to enter: Choose the closest match; you can add detail during follow-up. What happens next: We confirm the safest route and keep the submission clean and funder-ready. Truth line: “Outcomes depend on assessment and final approval.” 3.4.4 Battery & inverter upgrade You’re doing: Clarifying what you’re upgrading and how urgent it is. Why we ask: Upgrade type and urgency affect the route and what information matters. What to enter: Choose the closest match; “Not sure” is acceptable where offered. What happens next: We confirm the best route and the next simplest step. Truth line: “This is a short eligibility check, not a full application.”
