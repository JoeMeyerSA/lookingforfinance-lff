## 0.1. Repo-wide versioning rule (applies to all docs referenced by agents.md)

## 0.3. Change log

v1.1 (2026-01-08): Removed/avoided any wording that could imply personal lending is offered; removed unsecured lending example from business-finance list; avoided wording that could be interpreted as a formal offer.

Baseline rule: Any document that becomes repo-native truth (written as .md in this repository for the first time) starts at v1.0.

No resets: If a document already exists as an active .md in the repo and is already being followed, do not reset its version number.

Legacy sources: Original .docx (and any exported PDFs) are kept in docs/archive/ and treated as historical artefacts.

Bumping versions (simple rule):

v1.1, v1.2… = compatible improvements/clarifications (no change to behaviour).

v2.0, v3.0… = behaviour change, route change, or anything that could break implementations.

Latest version rule: Wherever a doc references UX0 / UX1–UX5 / SOL-01, it means the active version defined in agents.md (do not hardcode version numbers in cross-references).

## 0.2. Required “Document control” block (use on every CT/PRINCIPLES/REF file)

Source inputs (if merged): list of input files

## 0. Navigation contract — Five gates only (non-negotiable)

The website is organised only by these five gates: Individual, Business, Farmer, Developer, Solar / Backup Power.

Users must enter through one gate and remain inside it; do not present any alternative slicing (no cross-gate “solutions catalogue”, “browse all solutions”, or industry-based menus).

Any choices shown after entering a gate exist only to route the user to the correct dedicated Pocket Business eligibility form (or are captured as intent inside that form).

## 0.1 Eligibility flow contract — dedicated PB forms + form-specific outcome message (non-negotiable)

After selecting a gate and then a need within that gate, the only next step is the Check eligibility CTA.

Clicking Check eligibility opens one dedicated Pocket Business enquiry form in the Action panel (right) with guidance on the left. The form is 1:1 mapped to that specific gate + need.

Website forms collect only minimum viable identity + consent + routing + selection-specific qualifiers; do not ask early underwriting inputs (e.g., income bands, time-in-role/time trading) and do not request document uploads.

Any legal entity selector appears only inside the relevant Business / Farmer / Solar forms (packaging-only), never for Individuals and never as a solutions-level concept.

On submit, the payload is sent to Pocket Business to trigger follow-up automations. The post-submit screen is a confirmation/outcome message defined per PB form (not a generic site-wide message) and must avoid “approval” language.

## 1. Purpose

This document captures the experience principles, journey behaviour rules, and website copy structure that must remain consistent across LookingForFinance.

It exists to:

Reduce user stress and confusion.

Prevent misroutes and invalid submissions.

Protect trust and compliance in a finance context.

Provide a single, stable reference so builders do not cherry-pick from multiple “principles” documents.

## 2. Precedence and relationship to Canonical Truth (CT)

This is a principles reference, not the pathway spec.

Where a build decision conflicts with Canonical Truth files, Canonical Truth wins.

Canonical Truth that overrides this doc (active versions as defined in agents.md):

UX0 — Global rules

UX1–UX5 — Pathway specifications

SOL-01 — Solutions offered & scope boundary

Use this doc to:

Keep the overall pattern consistent.

Keep language and claims within the compliance boundary.

Keep homepage and solution pages consistent in structure and tone.

## 3. Compliance boundary (must be honoured site-wide)

### 3.1. Plain-language boundary statement

LookingForFinance facilitates enquiries and structured submissions to suitable funders.

All outcomes remain subject to funder assessment, affordability checks, supporting information, and final approval.

Nothing on this site is a guarantee of finance or a formal offer.

Hard exclusion: LFF does not offer personal loans or unsecured consumer credit.

### 3.2. Language rules

Avoid outcome promises:

No “approved”.

No “guaranteed”.

No “best rate”.

Prefer grounded probability language:

“May”, “typically”, “often”, “subject to”, “depends on”.

Keep tone:

Practical.

Calm.

Plain-English.

## 4. The core journey pattern

### 4.1. Two-stage model (locked)

Stage 1 — Choose first, then capture data

User selects a capacity (who is applying).

User selects a need (what they want finance for).

Only then does the user proceed to a short eligibility pre-check.

Rule: Stage 1 pages must not collect personal or business data.

Stage 2 — Dedicated pre-check per selection

Each need routes to a dedicated pre-check form.

Each form captures only what is required to:

Assess initial fit.

Package a funder-ready enquiry.

Route to the correct funder appetite.

Rule: The pre-check is not a full application. Deep financial details and documents are deferred.

### 4.2. Progressive disclosure

Show only what is needed now.

Apply as follows:

Start with capacity selection (labels only).

Then need selection (single choice).

Only then the dedicated pre-check.

Why it matters:

Reduces overwhelm.

Prevents irrelevant questions.

Makes the journey feel shorter.

## 5. Two-panel experience pattern (Guidance + Action)

### 5.1. Pattern rule

The user experience must follow a consistent two-area pattern:

Guidance area (context, reassurance, “why we ask”, what happens next).

Action area (the selection or the form).

### 5.2. Guidance content structure (scannable)

Use predictable blocks:

Where you are (one line)

What’s covered (3–5 bullets)

What happens next (3–4 bullets)

One disclaimer line (no promises)

### 5.3. Microcopy rules

1–3 sentences per explanation.

No jargon unless defined.

Explain the lender/process reason (risk, affordability, compliance, routing).

Where uncertainty is common, allow safe language:

“If you’re not sure, estimate — we’ll confirm later.”

## 6. Prevent mistakes (correct path must be the easiest path)

### 6.1. Selection behaviour

Single-select choices only.

One selection routes to one destination (one dedicated pre-check).

No bundling of unrelated needs.

### 6.2. CTA enablement

Primary CTA is disabled until a valid selection is made.

When disabled, show helper text:

“Select an option above to continue.”

When enabled, show effort-level reassurance:

“2–3 minutes • No obligation.”

Button label becomes specific to the selection (confirmation without extra steps).

### 6.3. Escape hatches

Users must never feel trapped.

Always provide a clear way to change selection.

If a user will lose entered data by changing selection:

Warn them.

Confirm intent.

### 6.4. Error handling

Field-level errors must be:

Specific.

Readable.

Actionable.

Avoid vague messages like “Invalid input”.

## 7. Trust and transparency (finance-safe by default)

### 7.1. Set expectations early

Always clarify boundary:

“This is a short pre-check, not a full application.”

“Outcomes remain subject to assessment, affordability checks, and final approval.”

### 7.2. “Why we ask this” (high-friction fields)

Provide short, grounded explanations at the moment of friction, for example:

Deposit / own contribution

“This helps funders gauge risk and structure. If you’re unsure, estimate — we’ll confirm later.”

Timeframe

“Timing helps us route you to funders whose process matches your urgency.”

Turnover / income (where relevant)

“This helps assess affordability and route correctly. If you’re between numbers, choose the closest.”

Solar / Backup Power installer details

“Installer details reduce compliance risk and prevent avoidable delays during assessment.”

## 8. Data capture principles

### 8.1. One solution = one dedicated form (routing clarity)

For every solution/need selection, there must be a specific, dedicated pre-check form.

A form must map to one submission type only (no mixed-purpose forms).

Benefits:

Clean routing to the correct team/process.

Clean CRM categorisation and reporting.

Lower user confusion and fewer invalid submissions.

### 8.2. CRM-ready structure (future-proofing without adding complexity)

Keep stable field IDs (do not rename fields casually once live).

Maintain consistent contact fields across all forms:

Full name

Mobile number

Email address

Prefer controlled picklists for key routing fields (e.g., purpose, asset type, timeline) to reduce messy data.

Avoid duplicate questions across steps unless the answer changes routing.

### 8.3. Clarity over false precision

Where ranges are hard to estimate, prefer free-form input.

Where “Not sure” is reasonable, allow it and handle operationally during follow-up.

### 8.4. Common minimums

Currency values are in Rand (R).

All eligibility pre-check forms capture:

Email address (required)

Mobile number (required)

## 9. Privacy and POPIA minimum standard

Every eligibility pre-check form includes:

A privacy notice.

A mandatory acknowledgement checkbox.

The acknowledgement checkbox:

Is unchecked by default.

Must be required for submission.

Selector pages:

Do not ask for consent.

Do not capture personal/business data.

## 10. Terminology governance (prevent copy drift)

PX-01 must not invent or redefine terminology.

All naming, taxonomy, and wording rules are governed by:

UX0 — Global rules (active version per agents.md)

SOL-01 — Solutions offered & scope boundary (active version per agents.md)

Where PX-01 includes example copy, it is illustrative and must be aligned to UX0/SOL-01 before being treated as “approved”.

## 11. Capacity labels (site-wide)

Capacities are labels only:

Individual

Farmer

Business

Developer

Solar / Backup Power

Note: The detailed eligibility definitions and entity selection rules are governed by UX0 and the pathway specs (UX1–UX5) (active versions per agents.md).

## 12. Website copy system (structure + approved blocks) (structure + approved blocks)

### 11.1. Homepage

Headline

Strategic funding, expertly navigated.

Short positioning paragraph

In today’s complex finance environment, finding the right funding can feel like navigating a maze in the dark. LookingForFinance acts as a strategic intermediary — we go beyond the numbers to understand your story, structure a funder-ready proposal, and match it with the most suitable institution from our network of mainstream banks, second-tier funders, and private funding sources.

What we do (3 bullets)

We clarify your objective and feasibility.

We structure a proposal that addresses what funders look for.

We route the case to funders with the right appetite for the deal.

How it works (3 steps)

Deep dive — Understand your objective, profile, and feasibility.

Structuring — Package the proposal in funder-ready form.

Funder navigation — Match and manage the process through to outcome.

Who we serve (aligned to capacity labels)

Individual

Farmer

Business

Developer

Solar / Backup Power

### 11.2. Our approach (three pillars)

Pillar 1 — The deep dive (your story)

We start with due diligence: objectives, feasibility, profile strength, track record, and the deal context. This helps prevent wasted submissions and avoidable third-party costs.

Pillar 2 — Expert analysis and structuring

We package the case the way funders assess it, focusing on three practical elements:

The applicant (credibility and track record)

Serviceability (cash flow and affordability)

The asset / transaction fundamentals (risk and value)

Pillar 3 — Navigating the funder landscape

Different funders have different criteria, internal processes, and risk appetites. Our primary value is targeted matching and process management — focusing effort where the probability of progress is highest.

### 11.6. Optional short footer disclaimer (recommended)

LookingForFinance operates in association with @360 Finance Stellenbosch. We facilitate introductions and structured submissions to suitable funders. All outcomes are subject to assessment and final approval by the relevant funder.

## 12. Accessibility and mobile minimum standard

Mobile-first readability: forms and selectors must remain usable on a 360px-wide screen without horizontal scrolling.

Clear labels: every field has a visible label (no placeholder-only labelling).

Required fields: clearly indicated and consistent across forms.

Input types: use appropriate inputs (tel/email/number) to reduce friction.

Focus visibility: keyboard focus states must be visible.

Error placement: errors appear next to the field, with a clear fix instruction.

Tap targets: buttons and selection tiles are comfortably tappable.

One selection routes to one dedicated eligibility pre-check.

Primary action is unavailable until a valid selection is made.

Helper text appears when CTA is disabled.

Error handling is field-specific and readable.

Guidance text explains what is happening and why key fields exist.

POPIA notice + required acknowledgement checkbox on every eligibility pre-check form.

Disclaimer language avoids promises and avoids “approval certainty” phrasing.

Solar remains a standalone pathway (no Solar options inside other pathways).

## 15. Drift prevention rules (how this stays stable) (how this stays stable)

This is the single active principles reference.

The four original DOCX sources are kept in /docs/archive/ and treated as DEP (Deprecated).

Do not re-create “principles” files elsewhere. If something is a principle, it belongs here.

If a rule is pathway-specific, it belongs in the relevant UX1–UX5 file, not here.

If a rule is truly global governance, it belongs in UX0, and this doc should reference UX0 rather than duplicating it.
